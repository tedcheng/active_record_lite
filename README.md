A lite version of Rails Active Record.
This implementation includes:
1. mass assignment 
2. database abstraction 
  *Class Methods all/new/create/find/where
  *Instance Methods save/update/destroy
3. associations
  *has_many
  *belongs_to
  *has_one_through


Undergoing some refactoring, to be updated soon.
